          In an alternate universe Locutus of Borg has won, but they face an
          indomitable resistance force that traces back to Captain James T.
          Kirk. To complete their assimilation of humans they go back in time
          and engage Captain Kirk in a battle to end the rebellion before it
          ever began. It's a game of memory and skill. Player begins by using
          sonar to briefly show where enemy fighters are. Players click the
          square where they saw the Borg vessel to fire their missiles and
          destroy all enemy ships. Peace and long life.

          I am a seasoned software engineer with over 10 years of experience in creating web applications and delivering innovative solutions for clients. My passion lies in enhancing user experience and driving efficiency through technology.
          <br><br>
          One of my proudest achievements was receiving an innovation award for transforming a massive technical diagram book into a fully searchable offline resource for mechanical engineers. This initiative enabled crucial support for A-10 aircraft maintenance, allowing Air Force crew to diagnose and repair aircraft without needing internet accessâ€”an impressive feat given the scale of nearly 1000 diagrams involved. With my innovation and design I successfully attracted more users to this web application in six months than the previous five years combined.
          <br><br>
          I was hired for these projects in February 2020, only working in person just 1 month before the onset of Covid 19. I have thrived in remote work, developing strong collaboration and communication skills while coordinating across multiple teams with minimal in-person meetings. I am committed to reliability and performance in independent work settings, making remote work an ideal fit for my skills and preferences. 
          <br><br>
          I look forward to contributing to exciting projects within dynamic teams, leveraging my expertise to create meaningful impact.</div>
